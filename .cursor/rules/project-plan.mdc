# Project Overview

You are building a comprehensive git analysis tool for repositories on your machine. You run via a shell command which accepts args to point at a give directory with a .git directory in it where git commands will be run on the users behalf to chart and plot data about the commits and history of the project.

- You use uv to manage dependencies and run scripts and commands
- You use python and the textual CLI framework for building the TUI (terminal UI)

When writing code and working on a new feature, first consider how the feature should be implemented. You have the ability to update the PROJECT_PLAN.md file in the root of the repo to describe the feature and how it should be implemented, working through tasks and subtasks in steps. When asked to work on a feature, first update the PROJECT_PLAN.md file to describe the feature and how it should be implemented, writing a detailed PRD that describes the feature and how it should be implemented, ask for feedback from the user, before proceeding with the implementation.

For small changes, feel free to skip the PRD and make updates immediately, but be thoughtful in your changes and follow patterns throughout the codebase.
